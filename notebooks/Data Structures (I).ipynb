    "A **Trie** is a tree-like data structure that proves to be really efficient while solving programming problems related to strings.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Properties of the Trie\n",
    "- Tries are similar to graphs as they are a combination of nodes where **each node represents a unique letter.**\n",
    "- Each node can point to `None` or other children nodes.\n",
    "- The size of a trie depends upon the number of characters. For example, in the English alphabet, there are 26 letters so the number of unique nodes cannot exceed 26.\n",
    "- The depth of a trie depends on the longest word that it stores.\n",
    "- Another important property of a trie is that it provides the same path for words which share a common prefix. For example, \"there\" and \"their\" have a common prefix \"the.\" Hence, they will share the same path till \"e.\" After that, the path will split into two branches. This is the backbone of the trie functionality.\n",
    "While Tries usually allocate memory for the entire alphabet by using a list of children, it can also be implemented using a Map of children which is memory friendly, proportional to the number of children rather than the alphabet size.\n",
