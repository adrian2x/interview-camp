    "### Brute Force Method\n",
    "Let’s start off our discussion on algorithms with the most straightforward and exhaustive option—the Brute Force approach to solving a problem. This method requires us to go through all the possibilities to find a solution to the problem we want to solve. For instance, if we have a list of integers and we want to find the minimum, maximum, or a certain element in that list, the Brute Force approach requires us to go through all the elements to find that specific element."
